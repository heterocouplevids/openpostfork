# Backups

You need the database, media objects, and secrets for a usable backup. The exact
commands depend on whether you run the self-hosted SQLite/local-storage default
or a hosted Postgres/S3-compatible deployment.

## What to back up

- SQLite database files or a Postgres dump
- Local media directory or S3-compatible bucket objects
- Your `.env` file or secret-management equivalent
- File ownership and permissions for the runtime directories

## Self-hosted SQLite and local media

This is the default self-hosting path.

Stop OpenPost first if you want the simplest backup path:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop openpost
```

If your deployment keeps SQLite in WAL mode, copy the database together with any `-wal` and `-shm` files that exist. Those extra files can contain committed data that has not yet been checkpointed into the main `.db` file.

### Database

```bash
cp /var/lib/openpost/openpost.db openpost-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
cp /var/lib/openpost/openpost.db-wal openpost-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db-wal 2>/dev/null || true
cp /var/lib/openpost/openpost.db-shm openpost-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).db-shm 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Media

```bash
tar -czf media-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /var/lib/openpost/media/
```

### Secrets

```bash
cp /opt/openpost/.env openpost-env-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

Restart when the backup finishes:

```bash
sudo systemctl start openpost
```

## Postgres-backed deployments

For hosted or cloud-mode deployments, back up Postgres with the database tools
provided by your host. A plain `pg_dump` is portable and easy to restore:

```bash
pg_dump "$OPENPOST_DATABASE_URL" \
  --format=custom \
  --file="openpost-postgres-$(date +%Y%m%d).dump"
```

For a restore drill:

```bash
createdb openpost_restore
pg_restore \
  --dbname="postgres://openpost:secret@localhost:5432/openpost_restore?sslmode=disable" \
  "openpost-postgres-20260518.dump"
```

Make sure the restore target runs the same or newer OpenPost migrations before
you point traffic at it.

## S3-compatible media

For S3/R2-style storage, back up the bucket or configure provider-side
versioning/replication. A simple object copy is enough for a manual snapshot:

```bash
aws s3 sync "s3://openpost-media" "./openpost-media-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
```

For Cloudflare R2 or another S3-compatible endpoint, pass the endpoint URL:

```bash
aws s3 sync \
  --endpoint-url "$OPENPOST_S3_ENDPOINT" \
  "s3://$OPENPOST_S3_BUCKET" \
  "./openpost-media-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
```

Back up object metadata and bucket policy if your provider keeps public access,
custom domains, lifecycle rules, or CORS outside the object data itself.

## Restore process

1. Stop OpenPost.
2. Restore the database files or Postgres dump.
3. Restore the media directory or bucket objects.
4. Restore `.env` or the equivalent secrets source.
5. Fix ownership and permissions.
6. Start OpenPost.
7. Confirm login, media access, and scheduled-post visibility.

### Example restore

```bash
sudo systemctl stop openpost
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/openpost/media /opt/openpost
sudo cp openpost-backup-20260518.db /var/lib/openpost/openpost.db
sudo cp openpost-backup-20260518.db-wal /var/lib/openpost/openpost.db-wal 2>/dev/null || true
sudo cp openpost-backup-20260518.db-shm /var/lib/openpost/openpost.db-shm 2>/dev/null || true
sudo tar -xzf media-backup-20260518.tar.gz -C /
sudo cp openpost-env-backup-20260518 /opt/openpost/.env
sudo chown -R openpost:openpost /var/lib/openpost /opt/openpost
sudo chmod 600 /opt/openpost/.env
sudo systemctl start openpost
```

## Migrate to another server

1. Install the new OpenPost binary or container deployment first.
2. Stop OpenPost on both the old and new server.
3. Copy the database, any `-wal` and `-shm` files or Postgres dump, the media directory or bucket data, and `.env`.
4. Restore ownership and permissions on the new server.
5. Start OpenPost on the new server.
6. Verify provider callbacks, media URLs, and scheduled posts before switching traffic.

If the hostname changes, update your reverse proxy, provider callback URLs, and `OPENPOST_MEDIA_URL` before making the new server live.

## Test restore checklist

- Can you log in with an existing account?
- Do previously uploaded media items load?
- Are connected accounts still listed?
- Are drafts and scheduled posts present?
- Does `GET /api/v1/ready` return `{"status":"ready","database":"ok"}`?
- Does `openpost instance health --instance <restored-url>` succeed against the restored URL?
- If the server hostname changed: do provider callbacks and public media URLs still point at the new host?

## Notes

- Test restores, not just backups.
- Keep database and media snapshots reasonably aligned in time.
- Protect backup copies of `.env`: encrypted provider tokens still depend on `OPENPOST_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
- In cloud mode, do not treat a database dump without matching media objects and secrets as a complete backup.
