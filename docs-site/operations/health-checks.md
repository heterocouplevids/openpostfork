# Health Checks

OpenPost exposes separate liveness and readiness endpoints.

## Liveness

```txt
GET /api/v1/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

Use this endpoint when you only need to know whether the HTTP process is alive.

## Readiness

```txt
GET /api/v1/ready
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ready","database":"ok"}
```

Use this endpoint for container health checks, deploy rollouts, and external uptime probes that should fail when the database is unavailable. It returns `503` when OpenPost cannot run a database probe.

## CLI check

The CLI can check the same public instance from an operator shell:

```bash
openpost instance health
```

Use this for deploy validation and operator smoke checks. The command checks
both liveness and readiness, and exits non-zero if either probe fails.

For remote scripts, point the active CLI profile at the public app URL first:

```bash
openpost instance add production https://app.openpost.example
openpost instance use production
openpost instance health --json
```

You can also avoid saved state and pass the instance URL directly:

```bash
openpost instance health --instance https://app.openpost.example --json
```

The JSON output is useful for logs and monitors because it includes the checked
instance URL, liveness result, readiness result, and database readiness status.

For support snapshots, use diagnostics:

```bash
openpost instance diagnostics \
  --instance https://app.openpost.example \
  --deployment docker-compose \
  --provider youtube \
  --logs-file ./openpost.log \
  --json
```

Diagnostics includes the CLI version, OS/architecture, profile, instance URL,
config paths, liveness/readiness/database status, token presence/source, and
authenticated user/workspace counts when a token is available. With a token, it
also includes account-provider readiness counts and the requested provider
status when `--provider` is set. Optional `--deployment`, `--provider`, and
`--logs-file` fields capture the deployment method, provider being tested, and a
redacted last-100-line log tail. It never prints raw API tokens or server
secrets.

## Recommended probes

- Load balancer liveness: `GET /api/v1/health`
- Deploy rollout readiness: `GET /api/v1/ready`
- External uptime monitor: `GET /api/v1/ready`
- Operator smoke from a shell: `openpost instance health`
- Support snapshot from a shell: `openpost instance diagnostics --deployment <method> --provider <provider> --logs-file <path> --json`
- Mobile app instance setup: the app validates `/api/v1/ready` before saving the instance URL.
